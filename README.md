# SpineAng2.0

3D Slicer Module for Detection of Vertebral Rotation using Symmetry.

This repository contains code designed for researching vertebral rotation in relation to the viscerosomatic reflex, as observed in CT scans with and without nephrolithiasis. The algorithm deployed utilizes Iterative Closest Point (ICP) registration and pairwise assignment of curves to generate a symmetry plane for already segmented vertebral models in 3D Slicer.

Previous iterations of this code can be found in the SpineAng repository. This iteration has been specifically developed as a 3D Slicer module to enhance usability and integration within the 3D Slicer platform.
